+ Project summary: In this project, we created two models for image classification. The first model is a CNN model using the package from TensorFlow on Python, using the noisy labels to train it. The second model utilizes weakly supervised learning. We applied label correction and used the corrected labels to train our model from model 1. The method we used for label correction is a different version of the CNN model. Overall, we see great improvement in model 2 because the weakly supervised learning process was added.

Contribution Statement:
All group members were equally involved in the planning and organizing of tasks for the project. Xilin worked on the first supervised model. Judy and Nick worked on the weakly supervised model. Tim worked on the final step that generated a CSV file combining all the model results. Tim and Dhruv worked on the writing and organizing of the Github repository, and Dhruv worked on the presentation of the project to the class. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
